# Sharing Resources
*******************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) it is possible to share a Resource:

* Directly from MapStore [Homepage](home-page.md) by clicking on the Share button <img src="../img/button/share.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> present in each resource toolbar

<img src="../img/share/share_cards.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

* Inside the resource (Map, Dashboard etc) by clicking on the [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) <img src="../img/button/sharebm.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-height:25px;"/> option (only for Maps)

The user is allowed to save a resource in different ways:

* With a direct link

* Through a social network

* With embedded code or APIs

## Link

As soon as the Share window opens, the link section is by default displayed:

<img src="../img/share/share_window.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

Here it is possible to copy the resource url link and access its qr code. Moreover only opening this window from the [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) it is possible to access the advanced options where the user can add the bbox param and coordinate and zoom param of the displayed map to the link.

<img src="../img/share/share_window_center_zoom.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

With *Add center and zoom to sharing link*, user can add coordinate information with possibility to switch coordinate format and allows users to click on the map to get coordinate information. The user can also set *zoom* value from the input field. By default, the center with zoom param is added to the share link with possibility to add a place marker by ticking the *Add Marker* checkbox. 

## Social

The social section displays like the following:

<img src="../img/share/social.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

From here it is possible to share the Resource in Facebook, Twitter and Likedin. Also in this case, only opening the window from the maps [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) the user can add the bbox and center and zoom param.

## Embed

Accessing the embed section it displays the following: 

<img src="../img/share/embed.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

With this section the user can copy the embedded code or the APIs, useful for example when you need to insert the resource inside a webpage. Also in this case, only opening the window from the maps [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) the user can add the bbox and center and zoom param.

!!!note
    At the moment the embed section is available only for Maps.
