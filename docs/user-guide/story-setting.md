The Story settings panel is available in Edit Mode and can be opened by clicking on the **Settings** button <img src="../img/button/setting-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.

The editor can enable or disable and edit the following components:

* The **Title** of the story, the default value is the title given to the story's resource in MapStore

* The story **Logo**, that can be for example an image that represents your organization or something connected to the story itself.

* The **Navigation Toolbar** to improve the story navigation for end users. Each section of the story is reported in a tree and the editor can establish which section should appear in the toolbar to allow end users to quickly navigate the story.

Saving the story settings and going back in View Mode, the top bar looks like this:
