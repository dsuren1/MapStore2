**********************

The **Change media source** button allows to access the Media Editor:

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/media-editor.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Through this window, you can add or edit three different types of media:

* Images

* Videos 

* Maps

## Images

In order to add an image, the stroy editor can click on the **Images** tab <img src="../img/button/images.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> in order to switch to the images section. In this section of the media editor window, with a click on the **Add** button <img src="../img/button/+++.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>, it is possible to define the image settings.

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/img-settings.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

In particular, it is possible to insert the following parameters:

* The **Source** of the image (its URL)

* The **Title** of the image

* The **Alternative text**, that appears if the link is broken

* A **Description**, used to explain the contents of the image. The description is available in the images preview list and, if the image is added as content in the *Pharagraph section*, in the *Immersive section* or in the *Media section*, under the image, as follows:

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/image-description.jpg" class="ms-docimage" width="400px"/>

* The **Credits**, displayed on the bottom-right of the image

!!! warning
    **Source** and **Title** are mandatory fields.

With a click on **Save** <img src="../img/button/save-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>, the image is included in the list of the available images ready to be selected for the current story. The image also becomes immediately available on preview.

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/img-preview.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

!!! note
    It is always possible to change the image settings through the **Edit** button <img src="../img/button/editing-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> also in a second time.

Once selectd in the list, the image can be included in the story by clicking on the **Apply** button <img src="../img/button/apply-button2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.

## Maps

To add a map to the story, the story editor can click on the **Maps** tab <img src="../img/button/maps-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> and so swich to the map section of the Media Editor. Here the list of maps ready to be used for the story is available: the editor can search and select a map in the list to apply it in the story or create a map from scratch by clicking on the **Add** button <img src="../img/button/+++.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to open the [Map Editor](configure-map.md#advanced-map-editor).

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/edit-map.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Once the map is ready, the editor can click on Ok to proceed with the next step and therefore insert the related map metadata like *Thumbnail*, the *Title* and the *Description*.

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/save-map-backg.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

With a click on **Save** button <img src="../img/button/save_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the map is saved and it will be available in the list of the *Current Story* maps. The story editor can select it to be used as a map component in the story by clicking on **Apply** button <img src="../img/button/apply-button2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.

<img src="../img/media-editor-window/current-story.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

!!! note
    By default a drop down list on the top right corner of the Media Editor allows to switch between maps currently used in the story (so the story editor can use again a map already present in the story if needed) and existing maps already available inside the MapStore catalog (that means that also classic maps created in MapStore can be used inside a Story).

Below is an example of a *Map* used as a background of a Title Section:
